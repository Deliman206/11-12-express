======

## Submission Instructions
* Read this document entirely and estimate how long this assignment will take.
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork
* Protect your repository's `master` branch by activating `continuous-integration/travis-ci` status checks
* Create a pull request from your `lab` + `<your name>` branch to your `master` branch
* Open a pull request to this repository
* Submit on canvas a question and observation,your original estimate, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request


## Learning Objectives
* students will be able to create a single resource API using the express framework
* students will be able to leverage 3rd party helper modules for debugging, logging, and handling errors

## Requirements
For this assignment you will be building a RESTful HTTP server useing express.

### Configuration
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughfully name and organize any aditional configuration or module files.
* **README.md** - contains documentation
* **.env** - contains env variables **(should be git ignored)**
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file
* **.eslintrc.json** - contains the course linter configuratoin
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `test` script for running tests
  * create `dbon` and `dboff` scripts for managing the mongo daemon
* **db/** - contains mongodb files **(should be git ignored)**
* **lib/** - contains module definitions
* **model/** - contains module definitions
* **route/** - contains module definitions
* **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains test modules


DONE #### Model
In the model/ directory create a Model for a resource using Mongoose (that is different from the class lecture resource). The model must include 4 properties, two of which should be required.

#### Server Endpoints
Create the following routes for performing CRUD opperations on your resourcee

DONE * `POST /api/<resource-name>`
  * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
  * on success respond with a 200 status code and the created note
  * on failure due to a bad request send a 400 status code

DONE * `GET /api/<resource-name>/:id`
DONE * `GET /api/<resource-name>`
  * with no id in the query string it should respond with an array of all of your resources
  * with an id in the query string it should respond with the details of a specifc resource (as JSON)
    * if the id is not found respond with a 404

DONE * `DELETE /api/<resource-name>/:id`
  * the route should delete a note with the given id
  * on success this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body
  * on failure due to lack of id in the query respond with a 400 status code
  * on failure due to a resouce with that id not existing respond with a 404 status code

WORKING ON## Tests
* Write tests to ensure the `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
* `GET`: test 404, it should respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
* `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id
* `POST`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
* `POST`: test 200, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body

## Documentation
In the README.md write documention for starting your server and how to make requests to each endpoint it provides. The documentaion should describe how the server would respond to valid and invalid requests.
